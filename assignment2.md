One of the major unanswered questions are how public housing residents are faring after a property was converted under RAD, or Rental Assistance Demonstration. These public-private partnerships sell a portion of a public housing property to investors to fix the aging public housing units, but it's unclear how the transition from public housing authority control to Section 8 housing is affecting residents when it comes to cheaper, cleaner and safer public assistance housing.

To answer this question, I would do the following:
* Reach out to the Government Accountability Office to review the results of the resident survey on the state of certain properties before and after RAD improvements. I would also turn to the GAO to learn how much money the government spent on those renovations and hopefully find out the ratio of government dollars to private investment for each property.
* Reach out to the Housing and Urban Development to find out which authorities have used RAD and label those places on a map.
* After I have the actual number and places of which public housing authorities have converted under RAD, I will search for active housing organizations in the area and reach out. I will ask them about the transition and if they could introduce me to any former or current residents of the property to ask them what the experience was like. This will be to add color to my story, but also to let me know if I need to add any datapoints.
* Based on whichever groups or residents who responded to me, I will then reach out to the corresponding public housing authorities. That way I'll have narrowed down to places and residents that will give my story color and depth. I will ask the authorities for data on the number of residents they had, cost of repairs the building needed, to look at the contract and find out how the authority tracked residents before, during and after the transition to ensure housing affordability.

From the information each authority gives me, I will condense it into the following datapoints:

| Maintenance Backlog | Amount Sold | Part sold (land or building) | Number of Tenants before | Number of Tenants after | Average Rent Before | Average Rent After |
