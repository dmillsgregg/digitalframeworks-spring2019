# Leaky pipes, private money
## What the U.S. is doing to address its public housing maintenance backlog
### By Dorothy Mills-Gregg
Public housing authorities across the country are dealing, much like some residents in the public sector, with aging buildings and how to best tackle mounting repairs.


That’s why under Pres. Barack Obama, Housing and Urban Development started a program, Rental Assistance Demonstration, to infuse private funds into public housing. Nine years ago, the federal government looked into Congress’s involvement in the issue of delayed maintenance and found decades of underfunding authorities’ capital funds led to a $26 billion backlog for repairs.


Some of that maintenance wasn’t just cosmetic, affordable housing advocates said, but includes falling roofs, upgrading security and fixing heating systems.


“If we think that it’s important in this country to house poor people,” said Adrianne Todman, CEO of the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials, “then we have a federal obligation to fix up these units.”


The federal government has transitioned over the years in its involvement in the housing industry. After World War II, the government invested and built housing itself. Gradually it shifted to a voucher system, like Section 8, and now that Congress has stayed so distant when it comes to funding the authorities’ much-needed repairs, HUD’s turned to private investment.


“I think we’ve discovered the more efficient way to do it is by adding the private sector,” said HUD Secretary Ben Carson several months ago. “So, you know, the public-private partnerships. Recognizing that there’s so much more money in the private sector than there is the government.”


The program works by letting public housing authorities sell a part of a public housing project to a developer or investor. This converts the property into Section 8 housing and gives private enterprise the opportunity to pour in additional funds.


Todman said authorities have often used the program, which is capped at the number of units that can participate, to update senior homes.


“Congress just has not been doing their job of fixing this problem,” Todman said.


Kimble Ratliff, from the National Multifamily Housing Council, said even when the government was controlled by one party, lawmakers were unable to find enough money.


“This was not partisan issues,” Ratliff said. “The money was not there.”


Now, one of the more vocal prominent opponents, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., has a bill that would be a giant check to fix all the repairs. But Ratliff said waiting is not really an option.

“That feels like holding out for a ship that’ll never come,” Ratliff said.


After Waters asked the government’s nonpartisan auditing agency, the Government Accountability Office, to investigate how the program is being implemented. Released in 2018, it showed HUD is not requiring public housing authorities to keep track of tenants throughout the process of converting the property, construction and transiting to Section 8.


Unfortunately, Housing and Urban Development does not collect and maintain all the data of RAD improvements so the public has to go to each authority to see how the program is working out.


“It’s band aids,” Todman said of the process without the program.

“This story is being told different ways," Todman said, "but I think context of RAD is one great tool, but it’s not for everyone.”


#### For the graphic
I’ve received data from the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials since unfortunately HUD does not easily present the data on money and conversions on their site.

Since Todman mentioned the Housing Authority of the City of El Paso, the largest PHA in Texas, I was also thinking I would ask them for their local data on the number units, estimated cost of repairs and how much investment money they were able to raise. I ran out of time to ask the authority to provide this information, which should be easily accessed on their 5 to 10 year plan, but it’s not available online. This would be an excellent example because of its size -  will help illustrate how successful the RAD program has been so far. I especially want to follow-up with this authority because it’s offering a [waitlist]( https://www.hacep.org/press-room/article/hacep-housing-programs-waitlist-remains-open-for-all-15-rad-communities) for its converted RAD units. I would love to visit their converted and unconverted sites to take pictures and bring the reader into the spaces. The other visual I think would be cool is pictures of before and after, even 360-degree cameras to put the reader in the housing to see first-hand what it was like.
