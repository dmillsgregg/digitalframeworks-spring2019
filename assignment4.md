I plan to find out if the Rental Assistance Demonstration program, or RAD, is addressing the public housing maintenance backlog. I will primarily be using data from the HUD website, but I was thinking of focusing on one or two particular areas that will help illustrate the point. 
To do this, I will reach out to the Housing and Urban Development public affairs staff and help me find all the resources, like the backlog list and how many authorities are using RAD, that they have publicly.. I've already found a very useful part of the HUD website (here)[url:https://www.hud.gov/RAD/library/tools] to use.
While reviewing that data and hopefully learning some of the scopes of certain projects, I will reach out to the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Officials and ask them their experience with how it is working and more data on the program and the backlog. Since Rep. Maxine Waters has been strongly against the program, I will also reach out to her office for sources and particular cities or states using the RAD program - I would contrast that with a list of "sucesses" HUD provided.
I think showing the backlog alongside a list of repairs would be the best way to present this idea, however, I don't know how easy it will be to line up the data and compare it. The other visual I think would be cool is pictures of before and after, even 360-degree cameras to put the reader in the housing to see first-hand what it was like.
This piece would be timely because rising house costs have become a major issue in cities and some presidential candidates, including one running who used to head HUD, Julian Castro, have commented on it. This story will be newsworthy because this program shows how the country is addressing the housing crisis, which is to sell off a part of the public land to make repairs.
