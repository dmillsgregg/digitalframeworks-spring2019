# Interview a dataset

I chose the U.S. A.I.D. [website](https://foreignassistance.gov/) and downloaded a csv file downloaded from the site's [page](https://foreignassistance.gov/explore/country/Mexico) on Mexico to see what kind of aid we are sending to our southern neighbors.
My first question about the dataset is for the staffer who grabs all this information. Is the department sending the amount or is the department taking any of these dollar amounts Congress passed in its budget? I know from past experience, what happens in reality isn't always what was laid out in law. I would also want to ask the staffer: What's the difference between a commitment and disbursement?
My third question is why some of the entries in column T, "Award_Transaction_Value" are negative. I would want to confirm if this is paying back previous aid that was dispensed as a loan.

For the excel document I created from downloading the csv file, I hid unrelevant comments columns, like ID numbers, and resized the columns so I could easily glance through the information.


A link to the dataset (which you can include in your repository), your questions, as well as the answers to those questions.
Additionally, write down all steps used to clean and analyze the data, including any Excel formulas.
Lastly, write a sample headline and nut graf based on the most interesting of the three questions.
This analysis can be related to your final project, but does not have to be.
