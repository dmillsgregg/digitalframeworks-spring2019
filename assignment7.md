The top-spending presidential candidates choose to spend their hard-earned campaign contributions on everything from the typical bread and butter of campaigns to the bizarre. My main question after reviewing Trump, Sanders', Delaney, Harris and Gillibrand was why did Elizabeth Warren spend nearly $500 on flowers at two events?

Clearly this isn't common because the other candidates spending the same high amounts spent money on travel, hotels and general catering.

I found this information on [fec.gov](https://www.fec.gov/), and from the homepage, began with "Campaign finance data" - Candidates. Next, I choose Elizabeth Warren after clicking on the section about Presidential candidates. That's when I saw she's spent about $5.3 million, ranking fourth among the highest spenders.

That's when I found her campaign has spent a total of $496.13 on flowers. So I compared that with the six other top-spending presidential candidates to find other incidents of flowers. I found Trump's 2020 campaign has [spent](https://www.fec.gov/data/disbursements/?committee_id=C00580100&two_year_transaction_period=2020&data_type=processed) money on medals and whatever "fleece and IPad Rental" is. Bernie Sanders' recent campaign had several high [expenses](https://www.fec.gov/data/disbursements/?committee_id=C00696948&committee_id=C00577130&two_year_transaction_period=2020&data_type=processed) from the famous camera store, B&H, in New York City. Delaney spent hundreds of dollars in Shopify purchases, and Kamala Harris did not have flowers either on her list, but she has paid thousands in event and facility costs.
