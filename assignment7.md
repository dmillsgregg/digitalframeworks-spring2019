## Pitch: 
Top-spending presidential candidates choose to spend their hard-earned campaign contributions on everything from the typical bread and butter of campaigns to the bizarre. My main question after reviewing the top five spenders - Trump, Sanders, Delaney, Warren and Harris, in that order - was why did Elizabeth Warren spend nearly $500 on flowers at two events?

It might seem like such a trivial amount since Warren's presidential 2020 committee has already spent about $5.3 million, but why is the fourth-largest spender using money to buy $500 worth of flowers when the other candidates are buying plane tickets and paying for hotel stays?

## Method
I found this information on [fec.gov](https://www.fec.gov/), and from the homepage, began with "Campaign finance data" - Candidates. Next, I choose Elizabeth Warren after clicking on the section about Presidential candidates. That's when I saw she's spent about $5.3 million, ranking fourth among the highest spenders. That's when I wondered how she's spent her money. So I found her [disbursements](https://www.fec.gov/data/disbursements/?committee_id=C00693234&two_year_transaction_period=2020&data_type=processed) and exported/downloaded the amount to Excel.
First, I found which column contains the reipient name, _S_ and sorted it. Once I found something interesting, i.e. the flowers, I decided to narrow it to just those expenditures by using the filter feature on excel and set it just to "Winston Flowers." When comparing her to other candidates, I also grouped items in the _S_ column by sorting it in excel.

## Summary of Findings
That's when I found her campaign has spent a total of $496.13 on flowers. So I compared that with the six other top-spending presidential candidates (wanted to balance for potential gender differences) to find other incidents of flowers. I found Trump's 2020 campaign has [spent](https://www.fec.gov/data/disbursements/?committee_id=C00580100&two_year_transaction_period=2020&data_type=processed) money on medals and whatever "fleece and IPad Rental" is. Bernie Sanders' recent campaign had several high [expenses](https://www.fec.gov/data/disbursements/?committee_id=C00696948&committee_id=C00577130&two_year_transaction_period=2020&data_type=processed) from the famous camera store, B&H, in New York City. Delaney spent hundreds of dollars in Shopify purchases, and Kamala Harris did not have flowers either on her list, but she has paid thousands in event and facility costs. Meanwhile, Gillibrand has concentrated her spending on meals, according to her expenditures.
I figured out the total amount candidates have spent by downloading the excel sheet of [this](https://www.fec.gov/data/candidates/president/?election_year=2020&cycle=2020&election_full=true) data.

## Headline and nut graf
#### Yard signs, campaign buttons and, wait, flowers?
The top-spending presidential candidates for 2020 have already spent a combined $108,354,662.80 to date. What they've decided to spend their hard-earned campaign contributions on has ranged from the typical bread and butter for campaigning to the unusual - Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has bought nearly $500 from "Winston Flowers" over two days. Other top-spenders, however, have spent money on travel, hotels and other operating costs.
