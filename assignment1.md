### Opportunity Zones
Republicans passed a tax break for companies investing in low-income neighborhoods in its 2017 tax reform bill. A new take on the failed "Empowerment Zones" from the 1990s that meant to encourage companies to move into impoverished areas, opportunity zones are fast becoming a business itself [itself](https://www.urbancatalyst.com/opportunity-fund-general-rules?utm_term=%2Bopportunity%20%2Bzones&utm_campaign=&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_src=g&hsa_ad=322366415689&hsa_tgt=kwd-426855436479&hsa_mt=b&hsa_ver=3&hsa_acc=7835876622&hsa_kw=%2Bopportunity%20%2Bzones&hsa_grp=67028276080&hsa_cam=1667240605&hsa_net=adwords&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_v31rcDV4QIVxbfACh3aDA5QEAAYASAAEgLIF_D_BwE). So, two years after the fact, to what extent are communities using these tax breaks to their advantage? We would create a map of the places listed as opportunity zones, and we would interview housing and job organizations within a few select localities to hear what change they have seen or expect to see by having that classification.

### Rental Assistance Demonstration
The federal government has been moving away from supporting public housing for decades, but those cuts have created a large backlog of disrepair for public housing units. To solve this problem, the Obama Administration started "RAD," or Rental Assistance Demonstration, to create public-private partnerships that sell a portion of public housing property to investors to fix those properties. In theory, the public maintains a stake in the property and tenants will have a better place to live, just under Section 8. But a GAO report released in 2018 showed Housing and Urban Development, which runs the program, is not requiring public housing authorities to keep track of tenants throughout the process of converting the property, construction and transiting to Section 8. First, we'll ask the GAO to see the documents they found around tenant tracking, then we'll choose a locality and ask for that authority's records on the transition. Our goal is to find people impacted by the change and tell the story of how this program, which Trump has twice so far to eliminate the cap on participating units, is panning out for public housing. This program impacts every section of the housing industry because if tenants are displaced, that puts pressure on an already-strained housing marketplace.
